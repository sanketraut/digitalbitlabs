### To be continued...

Congratulations. You made it this far.

I hope you were following the tutorial step by step and not just skipping over the chapters :)

If you got something out of the tutorial I would appreciate a star. It's the only way for me to see if people are actually reading this :)

Because this tutorial was so well-received, it inspired me to write a book. The book is a much more up to date version of this tutorial and covers a lot more. Click the link below to check it out (there is also a sample chapter available).
